\section*{Acknowledgement}
First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Kim Steenstrup Pedersen for both suggesting this exciting project and for supporting me throughout the project.

Secondly, I would like to thank Andrea Luongo and the rest of ClimbAlong for providing me with the necessary data and models. Without them this project would not have been possible.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my parents, Stig and Elizabeth, as well as my sister, Isabella, for their never ending support and encouragement.
