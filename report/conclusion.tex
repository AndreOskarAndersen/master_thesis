\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Throughout this thesis we have succesfully developed and testign various machine learning models for extending an already developed pose estimator for boulding, such that it makes use of temporal smoothing. This was done by pretraining these models on the BRACE and Penn Action datasets and further finetune them on a dataset for bouldering, provded by ClimbAlong at Northtech ApS. Further, three experiments for two different setups were run for each model, such that we would end up with the optimal setting of each model. Lastly, we discussed our approach, including our results as well as mistakes we have made, as well as argued that the optimal choice of model depended on ones needs.
