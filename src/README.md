The following directory contains my implementation for my master thesis.

The directory contains the following directories: 
    * data: contains code for downloading the BRACE-dataset.
    * features: contains code for preprocessing the downloaded BRACE-dataset.

To generate the used data, first, run data/make_dataset.py to download the data. Then, run features/build_features.py to prepare/preprocess the data.
